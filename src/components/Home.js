                I'm a software engineering major at Snow College with an interest in DevOps 
                and a desire to build excellent software. I love having the opportunity to learn and grow in the <br/>wonderful world 
                of tech and am excited to dig in and learn! I love learning and desire nothing more than the opportunity to work, 
                learn, and become as excellent as I can possibly be. <br/>As a person, I believe in doing things to the very best of my 
                abilities and taking pride in my work. I also believe that we as people lift each other up, we all have our own individual <br/>
                strengths and we can help each other become stronger in areas that we may be weak in. If we all lift those around us, we all become excellent together.

                    Ever since I was a small boy I have had a fascination with machines and cars in specific. I 
                    got my very first car right after high school, a beautiful 1990 Mustang GT. That was the fastest<br/>
                     car that I had ever been in. After I got a good taste of the performance that it had to offer I 
                     hungered for more. In order to achieve that higher performance I installed a turbo system <br/>
                     with intercooler and 70mm turbo along with supporting modifications and got it professionally 
                     tuned. Once tuned, the car made 415 horsepower and 555 ft. lbs of torque to the rear <br/>
                     wheels and would easily lose traction at 45+ mph with the press of the accelerator. I soon 
                     wanted better braking performance and stronger axles, so I swapped it from a four to a five <br/>
                     lug wheel setup, converted it from rear drum brakes to rear disc brakes, and put larger brakes on it all around 
                     along with hardened axles and a stronger limited slip differential. <br/>
                     This car was the start of my addiction. I have also owned a supercharged 2003 Mustang GT 
                     that I changed supercharger pulleys on and did supporting fuel and air system upgrades<br/>
                      to make 373 rear wheel horsepower and 389 rear wheel torque. My current mustang is a 2006 Mustang that 
                      was originally a base V6 car with an automatic transmission that I swapped <br/>
                      in the drivetrain from a wrecked 2012 Mustang GT that features the dual overhead cam 5.0L Coyote V8 engine
                      and 6-speed manual transmission. <br/>
                      <br/>
                      I have a host of other interests, including playing video games, target shooting, playing the guitar, building things,
                      working on personal coding projects, and a host of other things.
